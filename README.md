## Yo yo yo what is up guys. It's ya boy JM and boy does he have a message for LEON!

Right so we are gonna make a website. I have only just started this and that's why it looks rubbish - but we can do literally whatever we want and learn some really cool coding and stuff along the way. It's actually so easy - i reckon we could even have it called jamieleon.com or something if we really wanted to. 

Forget YouTube, this will be the next big thing.

(BTW, sorry if this doesnt wokr very well on phone/ipad)

### Quantum physics for beginners

Now, i'm not yet sure about writing maths on here. But that's fine, because quantum physics is easy, so we don't need any maths. All you need to do to learn it is to forget everything you know about the world.
