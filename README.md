**NOTES TO MYSELF**

Started in Feb 2020. Parts of the original README can be seen below. This was a 5 min job to engage my then 10yo brother.

Modified at the beginning of 2021, now that I know a bit more about web devs. 

NB the repo needs to be publicly visible for the website to be published. So don't make it too stupid.

GitHub has the option to enforce https connection so automatically gives the nice secure symbol in the browser, which makes it seem more pro.
By the looks of it can also just buy a domain and easily add it in. Good for Noahs Arc...

======================================================================

Right so we are gonna make a website.
Forget YouTube, this will be the next big thing.
